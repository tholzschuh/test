During the summer term in 2023, together with [Marius Leonhardt](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/%7Emleonhardt/) I'm creating the exercises and TAing the course [Galois Cohomology II](https://mampf.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lectures/149) held by [Dr. Alessandro Cobbe](https://www.unibw.de/timor/mitarbeiter/dr-alessandro-cobbe).
<br>
The exercise sheets will be accessible through the [relevant Mampf course](https://mampf.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lectures/149) on Thursdays, and will be discussed in the exercise session of the subsequent week:

* _When?_  Wednesday, 2:00 pm
* _Where?_  SR6  
* Contact: _tholzschuh@mathi.uni-heidelberg.de_


You won't have to hand in written solutions to the exercises, but I **strongly** encourage you to spend a fair amount of time thinking about them in order to get the most out of the exercise sessions.
