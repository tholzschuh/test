During the winter term in 2022, I'm TAing the course [Galois Cohomology I](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~schmidt/lehre/Alexander%20Schmidt%20%20Wintersemester%202022_23.html) by [Prof. Alexander Schmidt](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~schmidt/).
<br>
The exercise sheets will be accessible through the [relevant Mampf course](https://mampf.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lectures/142) on Wednesdays, and will be discussed in the exercise session of the subsequent week:

* _When?_  Wednesday, 2:00 pm
* _Where?_  SR3
* _First session:_  26.10.  
* Contact: _tholzschuh@mathi.uni-heidelberg.de_


You won't have to hand in written solutions to the exercises, but I **strongly** encourage you to spend a fair amount of time thinking about them in order to get the most out of the exercise sessions.
