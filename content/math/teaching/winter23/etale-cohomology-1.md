During the winter term in 2023, I'm TAing the course [Étale Cohomology I](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~schmidt/lehre/Alexander%20Schmidt%20%20Wintersemester%202023_24.htm) by [Prof. Alexander Schmidt](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~schmidt/).
<br>
The exercise sheets will be accessible through the [relevant Mampf course](https://mampf.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/lectures/167), and will be discussed in the exercise session of the subsequent week:

* _When?_  Thursday, 11:00 am
* _Where?_  SR3
* Contact: _tholzschuh [at] mathi [dot] uni-heidelberg [dot] de_


You won't have to hand in written solutions to the exercises, but I **strongly** encourage you to spend a fair amount of time thinking about them in order to get the most out of the exercise sessions.
